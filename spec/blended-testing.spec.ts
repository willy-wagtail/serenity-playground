         * This is a more advanced example of a Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern test scenario.
         *
         * This scenario uses two actors:
         * - Apisitt, responsible for interacting with an API to check if the system is up and running before performing any UI checks
         * - Wendy, responsible for interacting with the website to perform the actual acceptance test
         *
         * In this scenario, rather than list all the interactions in the test itself, we use:
         * - API Actions Class Pattern to group tasks concerning interacting with the GitHubStatus API
         * - Page Objects Pattern to group tasks and questions concerning interacting with the Serenity/JS Homepage
         *
         * Note that apart from strongly encouraging the Screenplay Pattern,
         * Serenity/JS doesn't require you to organise your code in any particular way.
         * This gives you the freedom to choose patterns and abstractions that work best for you, your team,
         * and reflect the domain of your system under test.
